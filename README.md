# EECS 573 Project

## To-do List
- [ ] Write C program
- [ ] Calculate the latency of switching kernel in C (CPU)
- [ ] Estimate the latency of switching kernel in RTL (Hardware)

1. Single thread performance
   - Different PE instruction size for PE
   - Different computation latency
   - Different CPU performance
   - Different scheduling algorithm

2. Multi thread performance
   - Different # of thread
   - Different scheduling algorithm (affect utilization)
  
## Expectation
- More instruction -> More scheduling overhead
- More computation latency -> Less scheduling overhead
- More complex scheduling -> More scheduling overhead
